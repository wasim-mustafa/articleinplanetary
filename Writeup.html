<h1>Title. Something to do with how our understanding of Enceladus has changed over time.</h1>
<h2>Early beginnings</h2>
<p>It was the 28th of August 1789, and William Herschel was getting to work. A skilled musician, Herschel had served in the Hanoverian military band. Wars in Europe, and a desire for an academic career, sent Herschel to Great Britain at just 19, where he settled quickly and trained to become an astronomer. By this time, Herschel was an esteemed scientist, working alongside his sister Caroline. So much so, in fact, that George III – Great Britain’s king – had commissioned the two Herschels to construct a 40-foot-long telescope: at that time, to be the largest in the world. Due to the social norms of the time, Caroline was relegated to being an assistant, despite being a talented scientist in her own right; indeed, Caroline was the first woman to be paid by the British government for contractual work, receiving a stipend.</p>
<p>Today, (the male) Herschel was using that telescope for the first time. In doing so, he discovered a moon of Saturn – later to be named Enceladus. Yet for all those forty feet of telescope, Enceladus was a dismissible speck. And thus, Herschel – a prolific scientist known for the discovery of Uranus and infra-red radiation – was not especially celebrated for his first-day discovery with the Forty-Foot Telescope, and Enceladus would remain an unremarkable speck for some time more.</p>

<h2>From a dot to something more</h2>
<p>It really did take some time. If you were reading an article on Enceladus in the 1960s, the last full stop in the chronology would fall about now, and the author of this article would be out of a job.</p> 
<p>Saturn’s rings shine brightly due to an ‘albedo effect’, as the dust grains comprising them reflect light. Due to Enceladus’ proximity to these bright rings, it remained difficult to observe despite strides in telescope design. Resultingly, little about Enceladus was known for two centuries from its discovery! Scientists could estimate parameters including its orbit and approximate size, for example by observing the perturbation Enceladus produces in Saturn's orbit. However, the understanding of Enceladus' surface was remarkably poor: surface albedo and topography could not be discerned. To discover more, rather than using telescopes on Earth, the ability to get closer would be required. And thus, two centuries went by until there was the requisite technology for further discoveries.</p>

The fly-bys of NASA’s <i>Voyager 1</i> and <i>Voyager 2</i> probes unfurled Enceladus from the veil of Saturn’s rings. The creation and deployment of these probes was a radical achievement for humanity: measuring instruments, such as for magnetism or for photography, were launched from Earth and into space, able to transmit data from millions of kilometres away. Not only was the probe technology hitherto unthinkable, but also the nature of how the probes could get to where they were needed: being lifted into space and deftly steered to other planets via propulsion. With careful mathematical modelling, the probe trajectories were aligned with expected planet positions so that planetary traverses known as gravity assists were possible, using the gravity of orbiting planets to be flung further along their paths and hence saving fuel (see <b>Figure 4</b>).

Due to the probes taking differing trajectories and being launched at differing times, the relative positions of Jupiter and Saturn to Earth were different between the traverses. As the probes passed by planets, they sped up via ‘gravity assistance’.

<h3>First observations</h3>
<p>In 1980, <i>Voyager 1</i> passed by Enceladus. Its closest approach was at over 200,000 km. Whilst this traverse was too far away to make out surface features, it was good enough to estimate Enceladus’ surface albedo (the percentage of light reflected from its surface) without the interference of Saturn’s rings. Whilst this interferece makes Enceladus difficult to observe from Earth, it is the most reflective planetary body in the solar system (see <b>Figure 2</b>) – a perhaps surprising observation. Images taken by <i>Voyager 1</i> evidence this, implyomg that the Enceladean surface is covered in water ice. As the image data were not granular, cratering could not be ascertained from the images (see <b>Figure 5</b>, below). The surface appeared smooth, suggesting that it is constantly being reworked – and that topographic features do not last for long.</p>

<p>This viewpoint was revised by <i>Voyager 2</i>, which passed by Enceladus in the following year. With a closest approach of 80,000 km, <i>Voyager 2</i> was able to produce detailed imaging of the Enceladean surface for the first time. As indicated by <b>Figures 5</b> and <b>6</b>, whilst images from <i>Voyager 1</i> suggested a smooth surface, <i>Voyager 2</i>’s fly-by revealed a complex surface! Though portions of Enceladus’ surface are heavily cratered, large swathes are not. Clearly, reworking of Enceladus’ surface must be occurring – yet <i>Voyager 2</i> imagery revealed that reworking is not even across the whole surface. This raised a question: what processes could be driving this complex reworking?</p>
