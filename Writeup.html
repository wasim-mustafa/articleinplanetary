<h1>Enigmatic Enceladus: a brief chronology</h1>
<h2>Early beginnings</h2>
<p>It was the 28th of August 1789, and William Herschel was getting to work. A skilled musician, Herschel had served in the Hanoverian military band. Wars in Europe, and a desire for an academic career, sent Herschel to Great Britain at just 19, where he settled quickly and trained to become an astronomer. By this time, Herschel was an esteemed scientist, working alongside his sister Caroline. So much so, in fact, that George III – Great Britain’s king – had commissioned the two Herschels to construct a 40-foot-long telescope: at that time, to be the largest in the world. Due to the social norms of the time, Caroline was relegated to being an assistant, despite being a talented scientist in her own right; indeed, Caroline was the first woman to be paid by the British government for contractual work, receiving a stipend.</p>
<p>Today, (the male) Herschel was using that telescope for the first time. In doing so, he discovered a moon of Saturn – later to be named Enceladus. Yet for all those forty feet of telescope, Enceladus was a dismissible speck. And thus, Herschel – a prolific scientist known for the discovery of Uranus and infra-red radiation – was not especially celebrated for his first-day discovery with the Forty-Foot Telescope, and Enceladus would remain an unremarkable speck for some time more.</p>

<h2>From a dot to something more</h2>
<p>It really did take some time. If you were reading an article on Enceladus in the 1960s, the last full stop in the chronology would fall about now, and the author of this article would be out of a job.</p> 
<p>Saturn’s rings shine brightly due to an ‘albedo effect’, as the dust grains comprising them reflect light. Due to Enceladus’ proximity to these bright rings, it remained difficult to observe despite strides in telescope design. Resultingly, little about Enceladus was known for two centuries from its discovery! Scientists could estimate parameters including its orbit and approximate size, for example by observing the perturbation Enceladus produces in Saturn's orbit. However, our understanding of Enceladus' surface was remarkably poor: surface albedo and topography could not be discerned. To discover more, rather than using telescopes on Earth, the ability to get closer would be required. And thus, two centuries went by until there was the requisite technology for further discoveries.</p>

The fly-bys of NASA’s <i>Voyager 1</i> and <i>Voyager 2</i> probes unfurled Enceladus from the veil of Saturn’s rings. The creation and deployment of these probes was a radical achievement for humanity: measuring instruments, such as for magnetism or for photography, were launched from Earth and into space, able to transmit data from millions of kilometres away. Not only was the probe technology hitherto unthinkable, but also the nature of how the probes could get to where they were needed: being lifted into space and deftly steered to other planets via propulsion. With careful mathematical modelling, the probe trajectories were aligned with expected planet positions so that planetary traverses known as gravity assists were possible, using the gravity of orbiting planets to be flung further along their paths and hence saving fuel (see <b>Figures 3</b> and <b>4</b>).

<h3>First observations</h3>
<p>In 1980, <i>Voyager 1</i> passed by Enceladus. Its closest approach was at over 200,000 km. Whilst this traverse was too far away to make out surface features, it was good enough to estimate Enceladus’ surface albedo (the percentage of light reflected from its surface) without the interference of Saturn’s rings. Whilst this interference makes Enceladus difficult to observe from Earth, it is the most reflective planetary body in the solar system (see <b>Figure 2</b>) – a perhaps surprising observation. Images taken by <i>Voyager 1</i> evidence this, implying that the Enceladean surface is covered in water ice. As the image data were not granular, cratering could not be ascertained from the images (see <b>Figure 5</b>, below). The surface appeared smooth, suggesting that it is constantly being reworked – and that topographic features do not last for long.</p>

<p>This viewpoint was revised by <i>Voyager 2</i>, which passed by Enceladus in the following year. With a closest approach of 80,000 km, <i>Voyager 2</i> was able to produce detailed imaging of the Enceladean surface for the first time. As indicated by <b>Figures 5</b> and <b>6</b>, whereas images from <i>Voyager 1</i> suggested a smooth surface, <i>Voyager 2</i>’s fly-by revealed a complex surface. Though portions of Enceladus’ surface are heavily cratered, large swathes are not. Extensively, long, arcuate grooves streak across the ice. Clearly, reworking of Enceladus’ surface must have occurred recently – yet <i>Voyager 2</i> imagery revealed that reworking is not even across the whole surface. This raised questions: what processes could be driving this complex reworking? How recent are these processes: are they extant?</p>

<h2>Large dot; larger questions</h2>
<p>It would be remiss to understate the importance of the images returned by <i>Voyager 2</i>. Before the imaging of Enceladus’ surface, the scientific consensus was that it was an unremarkable, probably icy moon without long-lived geological processes. Yet, several stages of tectonic activity are indicated by <i>Voyager 2</i> imagery. Consider the arcuate grooves. Ostensibly, these depressions on Enceladus’ surface are a product of heat dissipation from the interior. This heat would lead to Enceladus expanding, and hence the grooves may be extensional features. As indicated by <b>Figure 7</b>, cracks may run through some craters and not others, suggesting reworking of Enceladus’ surface pre- and post-cratering. Even more may be elucidated. The distribution of grooves indicates that there was a variable geothermal gradient across Enceladus’ interior as they formed. The gradient was lesser where craters are preserved – necessarily where there has been less reworking. This also explains the lack of grooves in the heavily cratered regions of Enceladus [1].</p>
<p>Observers noted that <i>Voyager 2</i> was unable to resolve craters with diameters less than 4 km on Enceladus' surface. Treating this as the lower limit, the recency of surface reworking can be determined for an assumed impact rate. The most conservative estimate for surface reworking on Enceladus at this time was that it ceased 1 billion years ago [2], yet depending on impact rates and the variability of geothermal gradients on Enceladus’ surface, it could be more recent.</p>
<p>Internal heating is required for surface reworking to occur. What process(es) could generate enough heat? Certainly, radioactive decay would not be enough. Over long timescales, this is provided by the decay of elements such as K / U / Th, which are expected to be preponderant in the inner regions of the solar system – especially the terrestrial planets. The only other sensible suggestion is tidal heating: heating due to being stretched by the gravitational field of other objects. However, modelling indicated that tidal heating might not be sufficient to explain surface reworking on Enceladus [2], as its orbit is not eccentric enough. Eccentric orbits induce flexure due to gravitational pull changing, and as Enceladus orbits, the direction and strength of flexure varies. Indeed, with an eccentricity of 0.0044 at the present day (c.f. <b>Figure 8</b>), Enceladus orbits Saturn nearly equidistantly at all times [2]. Approximately 20x more eccentricity in the orbit would be required to melt Enceladus' interior, yet the present eccentricity might be enough to maintain a pre-existing molten interior on geological timescales. Zanier theories, such as torque produced by other Saturnian moons upon Enceladus causing heating, were postulated as means for generating the required heat [2]. Initial radioactive decay, alongside tidal heating, could have been enough to kickstart melting, with tidal heating being able to maintain it.</p>
<p>Some questions remained unsolved. What could cause an inconsistent geothermal gradient within Enceladus' interior? How could radioactive elements, typically found in rocks, be entrained within an icy moon? These will be revisited as we jump forward in the chronology to the Cassini fly-by.</p>

Eccentricities ≥1 mean that the orbiting object has reached escape velocity and will cease to orbit. Greater orbit eccentricities can induce tidal heating due to the flexure of an object as it moves in close and pulls further away.</figcaption>

<h2>Cassini: a titan of an orbiter</h2>
<p>The chronology continues. Though <i>Voyager 2</i> was a leap in innovation and space-exploration prowess, the <i>Cassini</i> orbiter – which launched in 1997 – amassed data that are still used today, and provide the bulk of our understanding on Enceladus. Before being retired in 2017, <i>Cassini</i> flew past Enceladus eight times. Its imaging systems were sophisticated, observing surface features in greater detail. <b>Figure 9</b> is an image taken of grooves in southern Enceladus. By conjoining visible-light and radar data, fine features surrounding grooves could be discerned, strongly suggesting extension.</p>

<span class="img-container">

<p><i>Cassini</i> provided more than imagery. A question which puzzled scholars poring over <i>Voyager 2</i> observations is Enceladus’ position at the apex of one of Saturn's rings, known as the E-ring (see <b>Figure 10</b>). Saturnian rings are geologically short-lived, and their material requires replenishment; presumably, Enceladus is the E-ring material source. However, a means for this was not known. <i>Cassini</i>’s first fly-by provided an answer. <b>Figure 11</b> illustrates ‘plume ejecta’ being released from Enceladus’ surface and into space. Sampling of these ejecta indicated that they have an icy and NaCl-rich composition [3].</p>
<p>These ejecta tell more of a story. <i>Cassini</i> also detected trace amounts of silica nanograins within them. Both the presence of NaCl – which is dissolved into water by the weathering of rocks – and silica suggests that liquid water within Enceladus interacted with silicate rocks at hydrothermal temperatures of perhaps 90°C [3]. In fact, silica forms more readily at higher pH – which are induced by salt dissolution – and so the presence of both in plume ejecta strongly alludes to there being liquid salt water within Enceladus’ interior. Hence, the plume discovery revealed several things: that Enceladus has a liquid water ocean underneath its surface, that it has a rocky core, and that hydrothermal interactions are occurring between these. Just from a few icy-dusty particles, the broad structure of Enceladus’ interior could be elucidated. Gravitational field measurements, also taken by <i>Cassini</i>, allude to this ocean extending across the whole Moon, and that it is about 10 kilometres thick [3].</p>

These images were taken at distances between 144,350-149,500 km. <i>Images and animation by NASA-JPL, as such falling under fair use.</i></figcaption>

<p>These discoveries alluded to another substantial question: how could the interior of Enceladus have first melted if tidal heating is insufficient? We would not expect water to contain a significant amount of radioactive isotopes. However, silicate rocks may contain both short lived (e.g., Al) and long-lived (e.g., U) radioactive isotopes, which upon decay would have sourced the heat responsible for initial melting – perhaps in conjunction with tidal heating.</p>
<p>And what about the hypothesis of variable geothermal gradients across Enceladus’ interior, which would explain the diversity of surface terrains? Infrared measurements taken by <i>Cassini</i> illustrate the heterogeneity in emitted infrared radiation across Enceladus’ surface (see <b>Figure 12</b>). One observation is just how much heat is being emitted from Enceladus’ south pole, which is the region from which plumes are sourced. Four large extensional features known as ‘tiger stripes’ may be seen streaking across Enceladus’ southern regions, presumably due to this heat (see <b>Figure 13</b>). These are similar to the grooves discussed previously, though far larger in scale - hundreds of kilometres long, two kilometres wide and hundreds of metres deep. An indication of high haet flux, it is believed that the ocean extends closer to the surface - and the icy crust is thinner - in these regions. Ultimately, even with all these data our understanding of how geothermal heterogeneity came to be is impaired.</p>

<h2>What next?</h2>
<p>Observations from <i>Cassini</i> fly-bys have revealed much about Enceladus’ interior. However, we can only infer about the provenance of why Enceladus has its features. What caused there to be a geothermal gradient, or a variable ocean thickness across Enceladus? Is Enceladus’ model more complicated than a silicate core, global water ocean and icy crust? Could an Enceladean water ocean harbour life? These are interesting questions which could be addressed with surficial exploration. There are other considerations: would it be acceptable to leave a rover on Enceladus’ surface if the planet could be suitable for life? And would exploration constitute value for money? Whilst Enceladean studies remain of great interest, the future remains to be seen.</p>
